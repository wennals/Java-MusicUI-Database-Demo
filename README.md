# Java-Bank-Account
This is my code for a coding challenge that involved creating a java class for a bank account. 

## How to push code to the github
- git add .
- git commit -m "A message goes here"
- git push origin <branch name>

## Commands to remember
- git status (This command allows you to check with files are staged for or un-tracked)
- git checkout -b <new branch name>
- git pull origin <branch name> (This will pull down the code currently in github for the branch you're working on, it will override any unsaved changes)
- git stash (removed unsaved changes and stores them in cache, these changes can be retrieved if desired)
